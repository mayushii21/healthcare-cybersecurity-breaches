# Analysis of Healthcare Cybersecurity Breaches

The [Jupyter Notebook](/analysis.ipynb) in this repository is an analysis report of cybersecurity breaches of healthcare organizations in the US. Entity names have been anonymized using SHA256 hashing for security reasons. The report provides insights into the structure, contents, and characteristics of the data, including:

- a description of key attributes, structure, and format of the data
- basic statistics (e.g., data types, unique values, etc.)
- insights and observations regarding notable patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data
- a discussion of potential difficulties and challenges that might arise when integrating this dataset with other data sources
- recommendations and approaches to address the identified challenges and ensure successful integration with additional data sources
- a proposed normalized database schema for more efficient data storage and easier data manipulation without data anomalies
